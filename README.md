Udacity Landing Page

This project to creat dynamic menu
it has some HTML and CSS styling and i used JavaScript to convert this project from a static project to an interactive oneof the Landing Page project.   i required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

 i open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

I added in my project the #[navBar]
Also i Make a "smooth scroll" when clicking on the "navbar link" to scroll down to the section smoothly.
And i added calculating the height of the section from the viewport, and when scrolling and reaching the desired section, the active class is added to the navbar in the section that you reached.
